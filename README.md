The 2° Window
=============

Despite [consistent warnings](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report) that humankind is running out of time to avert catastrophic climate change which threatens the survival of our species, emissions levels continue to rise.

This countdown is quite simply the most important set of numbers for humankind, yet they are not widely seen, followed or even known.

Based on work by [Nick Evershed at The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2017/jan/19/carbon-countdown-clock-how-much-of-the-worlds-carbon-budget-have-we-spent), _The 2° Window_ projects these numbers as live calculations onto video of public squares and iconic gathering places around the world. The project displays the sliver of time within which humankind must restructure global energy infrastructure to avoid locking in a 2 degree global temperature rise.
